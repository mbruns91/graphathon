# pyiron_colab

Playground for collaborative environment in order to create a workflow in parallel by distributing nodes (i.e. tasks) to different people.

## Basic idea

1. Create a workflow in a large group, with empty nodes with only inputs and outputs defined
2. Distribute the nodes to different people
3. As people finish their tasks, they push the nodes to the repository, where CI takes care of the workflow execution
